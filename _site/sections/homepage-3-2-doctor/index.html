      <p class="text-left">Dr. Retzlaff was born in Canada but his family moved to southwest Portland while he was in elementary school and considers himself a native Oregonian. As a second generation dentist, he treats his patients the way he wants to be treated and stresses building patient relationships to fulfill and maintain healthy smiles. Dr. Retzlaff established his Oregon City practice 25 years ago and most enjoys the restorative and cosmetic aspect of dentistry. He is excited about implant dentistry's possibilities for his patients with missing teeth and their opportunities for restored dental function.</p>
