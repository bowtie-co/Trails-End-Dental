My entire family has been going to Dr. Retzlaff for many years. Doug and his staff are very professional, yet they make going to the dentist almost fun. He is very good about explaining what needs to be done, and outlining all the options.Doug has been known to break into song while doing his work, and I'm not always sure if his singing or the drill are more painful. But seriously folks, I would recommend Doug and his staff highly.
